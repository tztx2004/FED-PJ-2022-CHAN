        cdesc: `The multiverse would be a much less lively place without the hijinks and shenanigans of the former Dr. Harleen Quinzel, the one and only Clown Princess of Crime.
        ^
        Sometimes love can make people do crazy things. Other times? It drives them completely insane. Such is the case with Harley Quinn, formerly Dr. Harleen Quinzel. A promising psychologist and intern at Arkham Asylum in Gotham City, Harleen was given the chance to get up close and personal with the Joker, an experience that wound up ending…badly. Harleen became obsessed with her subject, and after falling madly in love with the Clown Prince of Crime, she helped him escape the asylum.
        ^
        Her love for the Joker inspired Harleen to adopt a new identity, that of Harley Quinn, the Joker’s sidekick-slash-love interest—whether he wanted one or not. (Most of the time? He did not.)
        ^
        In time, Harley came to realize the Joker was holding her back and she struck out on her own. She became an entrepreneur and a member of several slightly less-than-reputable super teams (including the Suicide Squad), Gotham City’s all-girl gang the Gotham City Sirens, and a traveling sideshow. Along the way Harley has become one of the most popular super-villains in the DC Universe, thanks in part to her versatility, charisma and cheery-but-deranged outlook on life.

        After all, as Harley would say, if you're going to go a little crazy, you may as well sit back and enjoy the ride!`,

        cdesc: `Jade Nguyen's lethal martial arts skills and affinity for poisons have made her a dangerous and alluring enemy—and sometimes ally—to numerous heroes and villains.
        ^
        Bold, brave and decidedly deadly, Jade Nguyen had a tragic and violent childhood. Born to a Vietnamese woman raped by U.S. Senator Robert Pullman, she was sold into slavery and killed her master, setting her down a lethal path that continues to this day. As a teenager, Jade refined her assassination techniques, studying under all manner of killers and masters of the lethal arts. Her teachers included the revolutionary Weng Chan and the assassin Kruen Musenda, a.k.a. Spitting Cobra, to whom Jade was married for two years until his death.
        ^
        By her late teens, Jade had become known as Cheshire, a famed martial artist and assassin who specializes in the use of poison. With a reputation for being efficient and tight-lipped, Cheshire has accepted contracts from a variety of organizations, including the League of Assassins and the Secret Society of Super-Villains. In the process, she’s frequently fought against Earth’s heroes.
        ^
        There is, however, one major exception. Earlier in her life, Cheshire fell in love with the former Teen Titan named Roy Harper when he was working undercover. Their relationship produced a daughter, Lian, who was believed to have been killed during an attack on Roy’s hometown of Star City. It turns out that’s not the case—Lian is alive and living on the streets of Gotham. However, far from giving Cheshire something to live for, motherhood seems to have made Jade that much colder. With Roy and her daughter out of her life, any connection she had to her humanity is now gone and forgotten. The possibility of a more meaningful life is just another victim in her wake. `,
